Создание пароля

When prompted to log in, use your username, but instead of your usual account password, use the app password:
To get the app password
    Go to the bitbucket.org website and log in
    From your gear in the upper right, and click Personal Bitbucket settings
    Click App passwords under Access management
    Click Create app password
    Give the app password sufficient rights (probably write on the repo at a minimum), and a label related to the application that will use the password
    Don't forget to save that password
